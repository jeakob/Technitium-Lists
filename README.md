## Intro ✍

This is a strict, curated whitelist for [Technitium DNS Server](https://technitium.com/dns/) with a focus on enforcing privacy and security.

It helps avoid ads, trackers, and malware, and blocks tracking and telemetry whenever possible by default.

__It's a great starting point for people who wish to run Technitium DNS in a strict whitelisting manner.__
